Developing Pseudocode

Step A = define the problem

Determine the class average for the quiz

Step B - determine the main steps to solving it

1. Initialize variables
2. input sum and count the quiz grades
3. Calculate and print the class average

Step C = expand on steps
1. initialize variables
	- Initialize total to zero
	- initialize counter to zero
2. Input, sum and count the quiz grades
	- prompt the user to enter the first grade
	- input the first grade (possibly sentinel)
	- while the user has not yet entered sentinel
		- add this grade into running total
		- add one to grade counter
		- prompt user to enter the next frade
		- input the next grade (possibly sentinel)
3. calculate and print the class average
	- if the counter is not equal to zero
		- set the average to the total divided by the counter
		- print average
	- else
		- print "no grades entered
