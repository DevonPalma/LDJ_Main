A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real-estate
brokers. Last year, ten of the students who completed this course took the exam. The college
wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You’ve been asked to write a
program to summarize the results. You’ve been given a list of these 10 students. Next to
each name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam or a 2 if the student failed.


Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:
	1. Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the message “Enter result” on the screen
		each time the program requests another test result.
	2. Count the number of test results of each type.
	3. Display a summary of the test results, indicating the number of students who passed and
		the number who failed.
	4. If more than eight students passed the exam, print “Bonus to instructor!”
	

Developing the Psuedocode

Step A
Analyze exam results and decide whether a bonus should be paid

step B
Initialize variable
input the 10 exam results, and count passes and failures
Print a summary of the exam results and decide wether a bonus should be paid

step C
1. Initialize Variables
	- initialize passes to zero
	- initialize failures to zero
	- initialize student counter to one
2. input the 10 exam results and count passes and failures
	- while student counter is less than or equal to 10
		- prompt user to enter next exam grade
		- input next exam result
		- if student passed
			- add one to passes
		- else
			- add one to failures
		- add one to student counter
3. print summary
	- print number of passes
	- print number of faulures
	- if more than eight students passed
		- print "bonus to instructor"
